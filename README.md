### Instructions
- **Input:** To alter the input of the program, go to the main function in *rpn.cpp* and manually enter the array of strings to be used in reverse polish notation.
- **Running Program:** Run *rpn.cpp* without any extra arguments.
- **Optional Output:** To add an optional visualization of the reverse polish notation as an abstract syntax tree, call the ast function which takes in the same arguments as the rpn function: ast(test, test_length) where test is the array of strings.
